# reallysimpledayplotter
A really simple day plotter.
Uses the matplotlib library for plotting graphs. Link https://matplotlib.org/

This is setup as a sortof day or mood counter if you would like. You can change it to whatever you'd like by changing the axis labels.
Basically when you run this program it will ask if you will want to input a rating for a particular day. Type 'y' for yes and anything else for no, when its no itll break out of the loop and print the graph. You may also type 's' to search for a specific day and see its value.
If you did type 'y' then it will ask you to input a rating, an integer, then ask you if you want to add another day. All numbers are saved to a textfile and will leave off from the last day you inputted. 
You must do it day by day.

It is now a bit more colorful with the helpful included styling of the library. You can now search for specfic days, modifying a day should be a simple addition to be make in the future.

This only works on Python 3.6 for me.
